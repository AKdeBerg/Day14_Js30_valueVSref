    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    //primitive types are usually copy based
    let age = 100
    let age2 = age
    console.log(age, age2) //100 100
    age2 = 200
    console.log(age, age2) // 100 200

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    console.log(players, team) //it's obvious
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'anik'
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team) //it changes the original one!!
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    players.slice() //it returns a shallow copy of the array
    //using this I can make this work
    const team2 = players.slice()
    team2[3] = 'Lux' //now it won't effect the orginal one
    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players] //preferred way 1
    const team5 = Array.from(players) ////preferred way 2
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object    
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person //YOU CAN"T DO THAT to copy, it will ref
    captain.number = 90
    console.log(person, captain) //oop! the original also got changed
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {
      number: 100
    })
    console.log(person, cap2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {
      ...person
    } //very new ES8+ (2018)
    cap3.age = 'fifty'
    console.log(person, cap3)
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    //this means it won't work for nested objects
    const details = {
      name: 'anik',
      age: 200,
      social: {
        twitter: '@akdeberg',
        linkedIn: 'Sarwar Khan'
      }
    }

    const details2 = {
      ...details
    }
    details2.social.twitter =
      '@akderberg' //this changes will also be reflected in original one. {...} is one level only
    console.log(details, details2)
